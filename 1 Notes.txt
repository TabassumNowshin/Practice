For git bash:---

  to make a file it uses a $ sign followed by space followed by touch followed by space followed by file name with extension. ( the name cannot have any space or it will be treated as separate file )

  to create a git repository: "git inint" is used

  to add email to the repository: "git config --global user.email 'vv@vn'"

  to add name to the repository: 'git config --global user.name "Nowshin Tabassum"'

  to add a file to git repo: git add <file_name>

  to remove file from git repo: git rm --chached <file_name>

  if the file name contains space in it, we can add/remove it in two ways:
          - 2\ index.html (if file_name = 2 index.html)
          - "2 index.html" (it is suggested that we use double quote for windows)
  
  to check what is inside a git repo at any time: git status

  to add all files available with .html extension: git add *.html

  to add everything: git add .

  to remove all: git rm --cached -r .
